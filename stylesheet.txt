External Style Sheet - If you need to use your style sheet to various pages, then its always recommended to define a 
common style sheet in a separate file. A cascading style sheet file will have extension as .css and it will be included
in HTML files using <link> tag.
Here we defined three CSS rules which will be applicable to three different classes defined for the HTML tags.
I suggest you should not bother about how these rules are being defined because you will learn them while studying CSS.


Internal Style Sheet  - If you want to apply Style Sheet rules to a single document only, then you can include those rules in header section 
of the HTML document using <style> tag.
Rules defined in internal style sheet overrides the rules defined in an external CSS file.


Inline Style Sheet - You can apply style sheet rules directly to any HTML element using style attribute of the relevant tag. 
This should be done only when you are interested to make a particular change in any HTML element only.
Rules defined inline with the element overrides the rules defined in an external CSS file as well as the rules defined in <style> element.
